In this code named Database College System, I built a menu for 3 types of users, with different functionalities.
The administrator has the passoword and name defined in the program, and can add/remove 2 types of users, teacher and student, which is a value in the
users table from the Database.
The teacher can modify and view the register of students, and the students can view it`s own precences recorded by the teacher, and also cand download
them. The download functionality consists of runnig a 'for' loop, and with each iteration, the row belonging to the student logged in 
from the table 'attendance' is brought and writed in a text file. 
For all types of users I defined  an authenticator metod, which allow the user to log in. The main thing that this methods to is comparing the values
given by input with the username and passord that were recorded before in the DB. For the administrator, these values are given in the program, as 'admin'
for the username and 'password' for the passord. If mistyped, the program returns to the main menu. 
For each type of user I defined 'user_session', which has their own menus looped through a while, and for any selection, the user can do the selected
action, e.g. for the teacher, if 'mark student register' is selected with typing  '*' character in the console, the user can mark the register and wiew 
all the students register.
For returning to the main menu, the user has to select the valid option with typing 'o' in the console, and the loop will break.
For non valid option, a dismiss mesage will be shown, 'No valid option was selected'.
For connecting the database I use XAMPP, running 'sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start' in the Ubuntu terminal. For viewing the tables from the database, I 
use the browser to search 'localhost/phpmyadmin'.
